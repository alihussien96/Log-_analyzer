# Python Log Analyzer for Security

## Overview
This project is a Python-based tool designed to analyze web server access logs for suspicious activities. It parses log files line by line, identifies potential security threats based on predefined patterns, and generates a concise summary report.

This tool demonstrates fundamental skills in defensive security and log analysis, which are crucial for any Cybersecurity Analyst or Blue Team role.

---

## Features
- **Log Parsing:** Reads and processes standard web server `access.log` files.
- **Pattern Detection:** Uses regular expressions to detect a variety of potential attacks, including:
    - SQL Injection (SQLi)
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    - Directory Traversal
    - Attempts to access sensitive admin or login pages.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Counts and ranks the most active IP addresses found in the log file.
- **Report Generation:** Displays a clean, readable report of all findings directly in the console.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Core Libraries:**
    - `re` (for regular expression matching)
    - `collections.Counter` (for efficient counting and statistics)

---

## Setup and Usage
1.  Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2.  Place the `log_analyzer.py` script and the `access.log` file in the same directory.
3.  Navigate to that directory using your terminal or command prompt.
4.  Run the script with the following command:
    ```bash
    python log_analyzer.py
    ```
The script will automatically analyze the log file and print the security report to the console.
